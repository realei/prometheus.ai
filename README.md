# Prometheus.ai

**A human-centric system to tame and harness the fire of AI**

Prometheus.ai is an open-source project designed to empower human governance over Large Language Models (LLMs). It allows configurable control, behavioral monitoring, and ethical oversight of AI-generated content — tailored for different users, age groups, and psychological needs.

## 🌐 Mission

> To ensure AI serves humanity — not the other way around.

Prometheus.ai puts humans back in control of the AI loop through:

- ✅ Configurable usage profiles (e.g. by age, mental needs, knowledge level)
- ✅ Transparent dialogue monitoring and behavioral audits
- ✅ Human-centered value enforcement in LLM interactions
